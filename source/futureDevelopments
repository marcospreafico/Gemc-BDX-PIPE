GEMC Future Development

Wanted features:
================

- add magnetic field lines: /vis/scene/add/magneticField 5
(doesn't work for both fields why)

- make detector factories external plugins

- rastering option with g4 volumes movements

Code Improvements:
==================

- physics details choices (disable some physics, etc on the GUI)
- "ahit" general function to get infos (with auto, c++11) getVector(string), get3Vector(string)
   check performance hit
- speed up the search for same identifier
- add generic "system" that contains a list detectors, sensitive det, materials?
- optimize eventaction - too many vector<hitOutput> definitions? Can they br grouped?
- add DEBUG ifdefs for debugging part of code
- get screen resolution and adjust gui dimensions to that
- add /tracking/storeTrajectory 4 button
- add track verbosity output
- is atof thread safe?
- move all user actions in their directory:
  ActionInitialization
  PrimaryGenerator
  SteppingAction
- gemcOptions make it a library, pass it by reference not value!
- make calls like gemcOpt->get3Vector("BEAM_V")
- change primaryFlat to thetaGauss thetaUniform cthetaGauss cthetaUniform.
- add system name to material name
- sqlite support. Dropdown menu: available systems.



Fixes
=====

Log of load path should be corrected /group still show /group even though the detector is loaded
from a different path using the GEMC_DIR variable

----------------------

With gemc 2.4 released, here's a couple of additional notes:

The development version of gemc just implemented importing volumes from CAD.
This can be a game changer for many aspects of the simulation:

- cad import is now lighting fast.
- some volumes are just too complicated to implement with geant4 volumes (CLAS12 CTOF paddles and light guides, torus magnet, beamline details).
- geometry consistency with engineering model
- reconstruction could use the same cad models

In addition, gemc devel has now translation table mechanism and by the end of august it will have FADC composite banks. At that point gemc output will be indistiguishable from
real data - the holy grail of simulations.

If you have anything you'd like to discuss, this email list could be a good channel for it.



Gemc Release Announcement
-------------------------


GEMC 2.4 was released on 6/19.

To use at JLAB, set the proper environment:

source /site/12gev_phys/production.csh 1.3.1

The latest clas12 geometries have been updated in /group/clas12. Please use /group/clas12/clas12.gcard as
the starting point for clas12 simulation.

Please report documentation inconsistencies. You can also report bugs / feature requests on github (link below).
There may be small changes in the way gemc is run (see the gcard field properties for example), or missing documentation in some cases.
Thank you for your patience.

What's new
----------

- electronic noise
- database mechanism in digitization
- field properties
- neutron cosmic rays
- material, sensitivity options
- physics process catalogues


Notes
-----

- Simulations with clas12 10^35 luminosity background may crash the geant4 navigation occasionally. We're investigating this.
- Some bugs may have been fixed in gemc or geant4. To use the latest development version:

  source /site/12gev_phys/production.csh devel


What's Coming
-------------

The next version of gemc (2.5, currently "devel") will have the translation table mechanism and FADC output:
GEMC output will be the same as what comes out of data acquisition. In addition we'll have an improved GDML (and possibly CAD) interface.

The development version of gemc introduces external mblibraries. GEMC is being slowly re-written and re-organized into
separate libraries that makes use of advanced C++11 features and makes the code more object oriented. This will culminate in release 3.0.
